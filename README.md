# 📡 Real-Time Microcontroller System (C) with VC++ and RS232
## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a C++-based control system that bridges application software with embedded hardware. Developed primarily in Visual C++ (VC++), the system communicates with a Microsoft SQL Server and manages real-time hardware interactions through a master-slave PCB architecture using RS232 serial communication.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Real-time hardware control using VC++

- Master PCB supports communication with up to 128 slave devices

- Each slave handles various modules: I/O, sensors, and LCD displays

- Data exchange between VC++ and Java via socket communication

- Database interaction using MSSQL for data logging and queries

## 💡 Example Use Cases
- Industrial automation and control systems

- Real-time sensor data acquisition and monitoring

- Smart I/O and device management

- Embedded user interface with LCD feedback
